In `Flight Info Menu`, administrators can add, delete, and modify information about airports in destination cities. The IPTV system will automatically obtain the flight arrival and departure information of these airports through a third - party interface based on the airport information, and then forward this information to terminal devices through interface. The terminal devices will display the information on screen.
