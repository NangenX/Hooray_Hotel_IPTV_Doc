This section is available when editing an existing promotion. Here you can upload additional images to provide guests with more details about the activity or service.

**Multi-Image Support:** Unlike the single-image fields (Poster and Background), this section allows you to upload multiple images for the promotion detail page.

**Detailed Content:** These images enhance the promotion description shown on the IPTV terminal, allowing guests to see more aspects of the offering (e.g., facility views, specific food items, or activity scenes).

<font color="red">**Image**</font>: Upload hotel promotion images to be displayed on the terminal. Currently, only one image can be uploaded.

<font color="red">**Content**</font>: Use `Content` to describe specific information and details about the uploaded image.
