In `Weather Menu`, administrators can add, delete, and modify the names of destination cities. The IPTV system will automatically obtain the weather information for the next seven days of these cities through a third - party interface based on the city names, and then forward this information to terminal devices through interface messages. The terminal devices will display the information on a large screen.
